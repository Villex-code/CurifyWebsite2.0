      {
        "question": "Is there integration with e-Prescription systems?",
        "answer": "Yes. Curify offers full, bidirectional integration. You can issue prescriptions and referrals directly within the application, without accessing the e-Prescription portal."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does it automatically connect with tax authorities?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. With every receipt or invoice issued, Curify automatically transmits the documents to the tax system, ensuring your tax compliance without accounting errors."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use it from my mobile phone?",
        "answer": "Yes. Curify is a Cloud application. You have access to patient files and your schedule from any mobile or tablet, wherever you are."

      {
        "question": "Can I hide medical data from reception staff?",
        "answer": "Yes. With the role-based access control (RBAC) system, reception has access only to appointments and financial data, while medical history remains locked and visible only to doctors."
      },
      {
        "question": "We have an old system. Do we lose our data?",
        "answer": "No. We handle data migration. We safely transfer your historical data from legacy systems to Curify."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does it support different medical specialties?",
        "answer": "Yes. The system adapts. The Cardiologist sees fields for ECG, while the Dermatologist sees body mapping, all within the same unified platform."
      }
    ],
    "hospital": [
      {
        "question": "Does it connect with laboratories (LIS) and PACS?",
        "answer": "Yes. We support HL7 and FHIR standards. We create bridges so laboratory tests and imaging automatically appear in the patient's file."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can it be installed on our own server?",
        "answer": "For large facilities (Enterprise), we offer on-premise installation or Private Cloud options to meet strict IT security requirements."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are we covered for GDPR compliance?",
        "answer": "Fully. We use AES-256 encryption and maintain detailed audit logs for every user, ensuring compliance with EU regulations."
